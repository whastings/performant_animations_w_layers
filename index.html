# Performant Animations with Layers
**By Will Hastings**

[layers]: images/layers.jpg

???

* Me: Web Dev, Horizontal
* Talk about:
  * Browser rendering cycle
  * GPU layers: What? Kinds of animations?
  * Dev tools: Check for layers, measure performance
  * Animation demo: w/ and w/o layers

---

class: slide-short
# Our Goal

* Smooth animations at 60 FPS
  * Constraint: â‰ˆ 16ms for JS + render cycle
  * Rerender waits for JS (don't block it!)

???

* Goal: 60 fps
* Only 16ms! (JS and render)
* Don't block!
  * Dropped frames
  * Janky animations

# Browser Rendering Cycle

.col-one-third[
* Steps:
  * (Re)calculate styles
  * Layout (dimensions and positions)
  * Paint (to layers)
  * Composite Layers
* Can sometimes skip step(s) (layout, paint)
* Fewer steps = better perf
]
.col-two-third[
![Browser Rendering Dev Tools Screenshot](images/devtools-waterfall.jpg)
.img-caption[
  **Source:** [High Performance Animations][hp_anim]
]
]

???

* Steps to render...
* Recalc style whenever styles change
* Layout: Calc size and position
* Paint: Draw pixels to layers
* Composite: Flatten layers for display
* Not all required
* Fewers steps = better perf

---

class: slide-med
# Browser Rendering Cycle
## Layout

.col-half[
* a.k.a. reflow
* Calculate geometry of changed elements
* Layout can also affect:
  * Child elements
  * Neighboring elements
* Quickly becomes *expensive*
* Props that trigger:
  * width
  * position
  * margin
  * More: [csstriggers.com][triggers]
]

.col-half[
![DevTools Layout Screenshot](images/devtools_layout.png)
]

[triggers]: http://csstriggers.com/

???

* reflow
* Size and position
* Expensive:
  * Element itself
  * Children
  * Neighbors
* Avoid animating props that trigger
  * See CSS triggers

---

class: slide-med
# Browser Rendering Cycle
## Paint

.col-half[
* Painting can be *slowwwwwwww*
* Goal: Don't paint or paint as small of area as possible
  * Browser draws smallest rectangle encompassing areas to paint
* Props that trigger:
  * color
  * background
  * box-shadow
  * More: [csstriggers.com][triggers]
* Triggering layout will probably also cause paint
]

.col-half[
![DevTools Paint Screenshot](images/devtools_paint.png)
]

???

* Expensive
* Try to avoid/minimize
  * Avoid wide paint area (e.g. two corners of screen)
* Certain props trigger
  * Anything related to colors
  * Some really expensive: box-shadow, gradient backgrounds
* Layout usually = paint

---

class: slide-med
# Browser Rendering Cycle
## Composite Layers

.col-half[
* Browser paints to layers (like Photoshop's)
* Sends them to GPU
* GPU *composites* (flattens) them
  * But can do (animate) some things before this
  * GPU animations are *fast*
* Then ready for drawing
]

.col-half[
![DevTools Composite Screenshot](images/devtools_composite.png)
]

???

* Paint to layers
* Upload to GPU
* GPU composites... one image
  * But can animate first!
* Browser draws to screen
* Want to animate here

---

class: slide-med
# Using Layers

* Can cheaply animate position, scale, rotation and opacity.
  * `transform: translate(...);`
  * `transform: scale(...);`
  * `transform: rotate(...);`
  * `opacity: 0...1;`
* Need to create layer for animated element
  * Just using `transform` or `opacity` in an animaton doesn't guarantee layer
    creation
* Classic way: `transform: translateZ(0)` or `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)`
  * Forces creation
  * Don't go [too crazy with it][apple_home]...
* New way: `will-change: transform, opacity;`
* Sometimes automatic:
  * e.g. CSS3 animation changing position/scale/rotation/opacity

???

* GPU can efficiently
  * Move around
  * Resize
  * Rotate
  * Change transparency
* All w/ no painting
* CSS props: `transform`, `opacity`
* Have to get element on layer
  * `transform` or `opacity` != guarantee
* Hack: `translateZ(0)` or `translate3d(0, 0, 0)`
  * Forces
  * Can be overdone (e.g. Apple home carousel)
* `will-change`
  * Tell browser what you'll change
  * It can optimize (e.g. create layer)
  * See article in Resources

# Simple Layers Example

.col-half[
```css
.simple-ex {
  background-color: red;
  height: 100px;
  opacity: 0.5;
  transition: transform .5s ease-in,
    opacity .5s ease-in;
  transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
  width: 100px;
}

.simple-ex:hover {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translate3d(25px, 45px, 0)
    rotate(45deg);
}
```
]
.col-half[
  .simple-ex[]
]

???

* Use `transition` to specify props to animate
* Start w/ `transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0)` for layer
* Animate opacity, position, and rotation

# Quick Caveat

* Text on non-root layer sometimes uses grayscale antialiasing
* Grayscale Antialiasing < Subpixel Antialiasing (default)
* Be careful when using layers on element's w/ text
* See [Antialiasing 101][antialiasing] for more

# Testing w/ DevTools
## Checking for Layers and Painting

0. Open DevTools
0. Turn on `Show paint rectangles`
0. Turn on `Show composited layer borders`
0. Check for layer and (absence of) painting

![Rendering checkboxes][rendering_checks]

[rendering_checks]: images/rendering_checks.png

???

* Press ESC, then Rendering tab
* "Paint rectangles" show every paint
* "Layer borders" draws borders around layers

# Testing w/ DevTools
## Profiling Performance

.col-one-third[
0. Open DevTools
0. Go to **Timeline** Tab
0. Turn on **Frames view** is on.
0. Check *Paint* in **Capture**
0. Start recording (hint: Command + r)
0. Trigger animation (if needed)
0. Stop recording
0. Look for frames less than 60 fps
0. Look for long JS, layout, paints
]

.col-two-third[
![Checking Perf with DevTools][perf_check]
]

[perf_check]: images/perf_check.png

???

* In Timeline
* Turn on Frames View
* Capture Paint
* Record
* Animate
* Stop record
* Examine
  * Look for slow frames
  * Look for excess paint and layout

  * Top and left
  * width and height
  * background-size

  * Relayout
  * No layers

# Testing w/ DevTools
## Example, Layers
